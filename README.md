**Brain Tumor Segmentation from MRI Scans Using Deep Learning**

***Project Overview***

This project focuses on building a deep learning model to automatically segment brain tumors from MRI scans. The model identifies the exact tumor region by generating a pixel-wise segmentation mask using a U-Net architecture.

Students will learn how to process medical imaging data, work with NIfTI files, build deep learning models, evaluate performance, and visualize results.

***Objectives***

- Understand MRI data and NIfTI file formats
- Preprocess 3D MRI scans (slicing, normalization, resizing)
- Build and train a U-Net segmentation model
- Evaluate performance using Dice Score and IoU
- Visualize predicted masks compared to ground truth
